# Advent of code 2023 in rust

Similar to last year, I have been tempted to go for array-programming with APL/[BQN](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/) -- but I am not writing much code these days, so keeping my rust alive seems prudent.

## General tools

Will use my hand-rolled [`aocprep`](https://github.com/Japanuspus/aocprep) from 2020.
