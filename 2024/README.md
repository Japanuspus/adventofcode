# Advent of Code 2024 solutions

This year will be python notebooks: I have not been writing much python since the big changes in 3.10 and forward, so this should be a good chance to get back up to speed.
As previous years, speed is not a goal -- I want to take the to explore some of the newlanguage features.

I will be coding in jupyter notebooks, but store them as [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) files.
