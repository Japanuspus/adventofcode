# Advent of code 2022 in rust

This year I was tempted to have a go at array-programming with APL/[BQN](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/), but I will at least start out with rust. Have not built much in rust over the last year, so this will be a good opportunity to freshen up.

As for the previous years, I will try to timebox my solutions were all done on the days they are released.

## General tools

Will be using `aocprep` from 2020 again.

## Day 1

Had to google `rust parse str to int`, but other than that it felt pretty natural coming back to Rust.

Same as the other years, I am thinking about ways to make the parts testable without defining too many types.
Maybe using owned strings for output and defining an `Input`-type for the day could work.
Also, the test-data functionality of `aocprep` seems to be broken.
